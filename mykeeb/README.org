** Why not an existing keeb
- [[https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard][REDOX]]
  - is very close
    - no HotSwap in the open source variant
- [[https://github.com/tadfisher/nyx-kb/][NYX]]
- Kyria
  - not OSS
  - to less keys
- [[https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash][ErgoDash]]
- [[https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel][ErgoTravel]]
- Zordiak is not OSS
- [[https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60][fortitude60]]
  - MCU is *Beetle USB 32u4* -> not supported by ZMK
- [[https://github.com/KarlK90/yaemk-split-kb][YAEMK]]
  - not supported by ZMK

Other interesting Keyboards are Lily58, Lotus58, Sofle,

** Goals
- it *must* be fully OSS
  - especially also PCB and case
- it *must* support ZMK
  - it *could* have QMK support
- it *must* support 3D printed case and switch plate
  - it *should* have tenting support
- it *should* be split
- it *must* have columnar staggered layout
  - similar to Kyria or REDOX
- it *should* have _a lot_ of keys:
  - got used to 35 keys per side. Maybe 30 could also be sufficient.
  - it *must* have a thumb cluster
    - maybe a combination of REDOX-style and NYX-style
  - it *must* have 6 cols
    - it *should* have 7 cols, i.e. an additional center column
  - it *should* have a Number row
  - it *could* have arrow keys
  - it *does not need* to have encoder support
- it *could* have 1.5u keys for parts of the thumb cluster
- it *should* have MX style switches
  - it *could* also have Choc compatibility
    - maybe specifically for the thumb cluster?
- it *should* have HotSwap
  - preferred via Kailh sockets
- MCU *should* be mounted visible, and not on the back side
  - MCU *could* have two sockets to choose orientation per side
    - I like them chip side up
  - maybe similar to NYX, Kyria or crkbd
  - MCU *should* use a standard interconnect like Pro Micro
- it *should* have PCB support for a switch and battery connections
- it *could* expose i2c for trackball support
- it *could* have RGB-LED for feedback regarding activated layers or modifier
  - could also be done via display
  - could also be done via the trackpoint led
  - it *does not need* any further LED stuff

** How to start?
- base on something
  - REDOX
    - no HotSwap
  - ErgoDash
    - one less thumb key
  - NYX
    - has MX+Chock footprints, but does not fir 5pin MX
    - uses Horizon EDA
- from scratch
  - https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide
  - which MCU
    - nRF52840
      - Nice!Nano
        - can do >=42 switches per side (41 on reviung41), using 6+7 GPIO pins
          - should be able to do 49, if one uses the LED pin? or even more?
      - nRF52830 Dongle
        - 15 GPIOs
      - Seeed XIAO BLE
    - esp32
      - has 11 GPIO pins 
        - max 30=5*6 switches?
        - hummingbird has 30 switches
