* Building a Redox Style Split with xiaos + Shift Registers

similar to https://github.com/maxhbr/redox-meets-dao-choc-ble, but with a different set of electronics.

** The Idea:
*** Take the electronics from revxlp / uninarf
- Maybe with potential for (partial) JLC PCBA assembly
- using the xiao footprint from the TOTEM
*** Take the Rough layout from Redox
*** Adopt to the pinky stagger from the Kyria
